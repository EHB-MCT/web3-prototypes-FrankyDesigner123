# React-Native Todo Application

This is my very fist react-native application where I learned the basics of react hooks, props, components and states.

## Features

- React-Native boilerplates
- Header component
- Create todo's using useState hooks

## Getting started

Run the application using expo

```sh
$ expo start
```
