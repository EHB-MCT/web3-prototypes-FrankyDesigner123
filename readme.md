# Specialisatiecluster: WEB III

The technology I have chosen for the specialization cluster is React-Native.
The reason I chose this Native mobile framework is because it's extremely popular on the market with a big community.

I have studied React-native during the period from October to December 2020. Some of the obstacles I encountered were making my application dynamic by using API server.
